# Fu Lang

## Introduction

Presently this language has no offical name. So for the time being is will be called **fu lang**.

Fu Lang is an expiremental constructured language exploring the potential productively of a logical stack-based grammar and the a size limited lexicon. The ultimate goal, should the experiment prove successful, is to allow Fu Lang to flourish as an auxilary language which is simple enough for anyone to learn quickly, yet powerful enough to be a complete form of communication.


## Lesson 1: Letters and Sounds

Most of the sounds of Fu Lang are recognizable by any English speaker. Only a few sounds will be uncommon to the English ear. These *foreign* sounds aren't difficult, so much as they simply require practice.


### Vowels

There are six vowels, three short vowels and three long vowels. Long vowels sound like constrained forms of the short vowels and are pronounced slightly longer.

| roman   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
|   a     | 'ah' as in 'father'    |     \[ɑ]         |
|   aa    | 'a'  as in 'fat'       |     \[æ]         |
|   e     | 'eh' as in 'bed'       |     \[e̞]         |
|   i     | 'i'  as in 'bit'       |     \[I]         |
|   ii    | 'ee' as in 'feet'      |     \[i]         |
|   o     | 'oh' as in 'pony'      |     \[o̞]         |
|   u     | 'oo' as in 'boot'      |     \[u]         |
|   r     | 'ur' in further        |                  |

TODO: What about `u` sound as in "duh".


### Diphthongs

Diphthongs are dual vowel sounds that glide together seamlessly. Fu Lang has nine diphthongs which are divided into three groups: iotic, omicronic and rhotic.

Iotic diphthongs trail off into an 'i' sound and are denoted by adding a `y` to the base vowel.

Omicronic diphthongs trail off into a `u` sound and are denoted by adding a `w` to the base vowel.

Rhotic vowels trail off into an 'r' sound. It can be trilled if desired. There are four rhotic vowels, three for the short vowels and one for the long 'i' vowel.

| roman   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
|   ay    | 'uy' in 'buy'          |                  |
|   ey    | 'ay' in 'bay'          |                  |
|   oy    | 'oy' in 'boy'          |                  |
|         |                        |                  |
|   aw    | 'aw' in 'dawn'         |                  |
|  aaw    | 'ow' in 'down'         |                  |
|         |                        |                  | 
|   ar    | 'ar' in bar            | \[a˞]            |
|   er    | 'are' in bare          | \[e˞]            |
|   or    | 'oar' in boar          | \[o˞]            |
|  iir    | 'eer' in beer          | \[i˞]            |

### Consonants

Note, we are considering removing the morphemic distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants.

| roman letter   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|   \|           | stop                   |    \[ʔ]          |
|   k            | 'k' in king            |    \[k] - \[q]   |
|   g            | 'g' in game            |    \[g] - \[G]   |
|   t            | 't' in time            |    \[t]          |
|   d            | 'd' in dog             |    \[d]          |
|   p            | 'p' in pie             |    \[p]          |
|   b            | 'b' in boat            |    \[b]          |
|   q            | 'ch' in loch           |    \[x] - \[H]   |
|   x            | 'gh' in arghhh         |    \[ɣ] - \[ʢ]   |
|   c            | 'sh' in shoe           |    \[ʃ] - \[ɕ]   |
|   j            | 's' in measure         |    \[ʒ] - \[ʑ]   |
|   s            | 's' in sun             |    \[s]          |
|   z            | 'z' in zoo             |    \[z]          |
|   f            | 'f' in farm            |    \[f] - \[th]  |
|   v            | 'v' in vine            |    \[v] - \[dh]  |
|   n            | 'n' in 'noon'          |    \[n]          |
|   m            | 'm' in 'moon'          |    \[m]          |
|   l            | 'l' in lemon           |    \[l]          |

|   h            |                        |    \[ɰ] - \[ɦ]   |
|   y            | 'y' in 'yellow'        |    \[j]          |
|   r            | 'r' in 'rain'          |    \[r]          |
|   w            | 'w' in 'west'          |    \[w]          |

Notice there is no 'h' sound, as in English 'how'. This sound, called the *aspirant*, is reserved to disambiguate the pronunciation of successive words.

Consonant digraphs are two consonants that are so tightly knit that perceptually they form a single sound. Below is a table of the permissable digraphs.

| letters         | sound                  | phonetic symbol  |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|   tc            | 'ch' in 'church'       |      \[t͡ʃ]       |
|   dj            | 'dg' in 'fudge'        |      \[d͡ʒ]       |
|   tl            | '  ' in '    '         |      \[t͡ɬ]       |
|   dl            |                        |      \[d͡ɮ]       |
|   ts            |                        |      \[t͡s]       |
|   dz            |                        |      \[d͡z]       |
|                 |                        |                  |
|   gr  ?         | 'gh' in 'argh'         |      \[]         |
|                 |                        |                  |
|   ng            | 'ng' in 'song'         |      \[N]        |

Note that `ng` can only be used at the end of words, not at the beginning.

Consonants and consonant digraphs are organized into various named sets.

| Set              | Letters                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Plosives         | `k` `g` `t` `d` `p` `b`          |
| Frictives        | `x` `x'` `s` `z` `c` `j` `f` `v` |
| Sibliants        | `s` `z` `c` `j`                  |
| Approximates     | `l` `r` `m` `n` `ng` `w` `y` `h` |
|                  | `m` `l` `n` `ng`                 |
| Semivowels       | `w` `y` `h`                      |
| Liquids          | `l` `r`                          |
| Nasals           | `m` `n` `ng`                     |
| Affricitves      | `tc` `dj` `ts` `dz`              |

The letters `k`, `g`, `t`, `d`, `p` and `b` are the *polsives*. They have this name because their sound is characterstically "explosive".

The letter `|` is also a plosive, but of a special sort as it has no inherit sound. It is called the *glottal stop*.

The letters `x`, `x'`, `s`, `z`, `c`, `j`, `f` and `v` are *frictives* becuase they all share that rough frictional sound that we tend to hear when two objects rub together. 

The letters `s`, `z`, `c` and `j` form the set of *sibliants* as they all share a hissing-like sound. Hence *siblients* are a subset of *frictives*.

The next two letters, `n` and `m` are the *nasels*. They require air to be forced through the nose when pronounced. There is another nasal sound in Fu Lang written `ng` which we will discuss in the section on digraphs.

The last five letters are all known as *approximates*. The first is the letter `l` which is falls into the category of *laterals*, and along with `r` is also considered a *liquid*. The letters `w`, `y`, `y'`, `r` are also *semi-vowels* becuase their sounds are nearly identical to those that can be used for vowels, namely `u`, `i`, `aa` and `r` repectively.

Note that consonant 'r' should be *not* be trilled if is starts a word, but it should be trilled otherwise. This can take some practice. Don't concern yourself with it if you just need to read through a word and can't preform the trill yet. But keep practicing!


## Lession 2: The Shape of Words

In Fu Lang all words are single syllables. There are no exceptions to this! Which means there are a finite number of words in the language, approximately 10,000. While still a large number, it is a managable size, and one can actually learn every single word in the language. This is quite unlike other languages, particularly English, which have hundreds of thousands of words, many only known to dictionary writers.

Word forms follow the following patterns, where `V` a vowel, `VG` forms a valid dipthong and `C` is a consonant or valid consonant blend. Beside each pattern is the number of possible words the pattern can be produce (excluding consonant clusters).

| Pattern   | No. of Words  |
|-----------|---------------|
| `V`       | 6             |
| `VG`      | 8             |
| `VC`      | 120           |
| `VGC`     | 160           |
| `CV`      | 120           |
| `CVG`     | 160           |
| `CVC`     | 2400          |
| `CVGC`    | 3200          |

### Consonant Blends

Consonant blends are akin to diphthongs but are composed of consonants. They are two constants that blend together will enough as not to form a whole syllable. Consonant blends can either be initial or final, and a few cab be either. Initial blends can start a word. Final blends can end a word. There are no formal restrictions to the form of consonant blends. The only neccessary stipulation is that their pronunciation not form a separate syllable.

The *approximates* (`l`, `r`, `w`, `y` and 'h') generally blend well with any other initial letter. English examples include `slow`, `flower`, `prime` and `twin`. Other languages have more exotic blends like Russian's `vlad` and Japanese `kyoto`.

Note that the blends `tr` and `dr` may be pronounced `tcr [tʃr]` and `djr [djr]`, respectively.

The sibliants `s`, `z`, `c` and `j` and very flexible in the formation of blends. They can conjoin with almost any other consonant so long as the two phones share the same voice. For example, `st` is unvocied and `zd` is voiced. Common sibliant blends are found in English words such a <i><u>st</u>op</i>, `sky`, `sport` and `sphere`.

The blends `ts` and `ps` ...

Final blands are more limited than initial blends. Again the sibliants, `s`, `z`, `c` and `j` can pair with almost any other consonant to end a word. This is common in English where a trailing `s` is used to make the plural of a word. But sibliants can also be used as the first letter in the pair, such as <i>be<u>st</u></i>.

    kt pt st ct ft mt nt lt
    gd bd zd jd vd md nd ld
    sp mp
    ps ts ks ns ms
    bz dz gz nz mz
    tc kc nc mc
    dj nj mj

While other initial and final consonant clusters are allowed, they are intended to be **used very sparingly**.

Here is a chart of all permissalbe initial clusters. 

|   |  l |  h |  y |  r |  w |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|
| k | kl |    | ky | kr | kw |
| g | gl |    |    | gr | gw |
| t |    |    |    | tr | tw |
| d |    |    |    | dr |    |
| p | pl |    |    | pr |    |
| b | bl |    |    | br |    |
| q |    |    |    |    |    |
| x |    |    |    |    |    |
| s | sl |    | sy |    | sw |
| z | zl |    |    |    |    |
| c | cl |    | cy |    | cw |
| j | jl |    | jy |    |    |
| f | fl |    |    | fr | fw |
| v | vl |    |    | vr | vw |
| m | ml |    |    |    |    |
| n |    |    |    |    |    |
| l |    |    |    |    |    |

Again these clusters should be used sparingly. 


## Lesson 3: Resolving Ambiguity

When words are pronounced in succession it is possible for ambiguity to arise. For example, if someone says, "ko sem", a listener could mistaken it for "kos em". Most other languages depend *stress* to clarify word separation. Fu Lang does not. Instead it uses two simple pronunciation rules.

When a word ends with the same consonant that the next word begins, a noticable pause between the words must be heard, or a short 'e', as in the English word 'bet' can be placed between them. For example, "kol lun" when spoken quickly will sound like "kol'e'lun".

If a word beings with a vowel which could create an ambiguity when pronounced against the final sound of the previous word, then an aspiration is used to ensure clarity. For example `sol en` would be pronounced "sol <sup>h</sup>en" to ensure it is not mistaken for "so len". This aspiration does not need to be overly emphasized, a brief and soft aspiration is sufficent.


## Lesson 4: Words and Valence

All words have a valence, also called arity. Valence is the number of "slots" a word has that must be filled-in order to be resolved into a complete idea. Of course the simplest words are those that have zero valence, called *zo wr* which literally means "zero word". *zo wr* are equivelent to nouns in English. They resolve inately and carry a specific meaning. The most commonly used *zo wr* are personal pronouns.

The next type of word is the single valence word, or *un wr* meaning "one word". These are similar to English adjectives and adverbs. They are used to modify or refine another idea.

Words with an additional valence are the simplest type to *relate* two separate ideas together. These *bai wr* can be simple verbs, or they can be categorizers. Categorizers are very important in Fu Lang because of the limited size of the lexicon. They allow nuanced ideas to be expressed.

    ley xat kor
    it stripe coloring
    it has stripped coloring

In this example, *kor* is a *bai wr* that takes any idea and sepecifies the color or type of coloring it has.

Three and four valence words are always verbs. Words never have more than four slots. And four slot words are rare.

When defining words, numbered variables are used to express the order of the slots. For example, the definition of *kor* is: *x<sub>1</sub>* is the color or has a visual appearence of type *x<sub>2</sub>*.


## Gammar

Fu Lang has a *stack-based* grammar. Whenever a word is given (whether in speech or writing) it is placed on an imaginary "stack". ...


## Lesson 4: Sentences

Sentence are *complete* if they fully resolve. Any sentence left with unfilled slots is an incomplete thought.

    je fem
    I am female

    a na tu mor
    I you love
    I love you

But what is someone just said,

    fem.

The word `fem` takes an argument, which is not given. So this is an incomplete sentence. However, this does not mean that such utterances are of no use. It may have been the completion of another persons sentence, or the missing object may be implied by the context of the conversation.


## Lession 5: Negation

There are few different types of negation.

Set negation, 'nu', refers to a set of things from which a given object is excluded. For example, `vu nu` means everyone but you, or in other words 'I and them'. The exact set is contextual, it does not necessarily mean the set of all things.

... negation, 'nay', refers to the opposite of a thing. For instance the opposite of 'up' is 'down' and the opposite of 'joy' is 'misery'. This form of negation is open to interpretation.


## Lesson 5: Personal Pronouns

Pronouns are the most commonly used *zo wr*.

| Person  |             |                 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
|     1st | je/ay/mi    | I               |
|     2nd | vu          | you             |
|     3rd | ley         | he/she/it       |

There is also a *4th Person* pronoun `fo` which is similar to 3rd person but is used to distinguish the two references.

Using negation we can speak of *negtive persons*.

| Person  |             |                 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
|    -1st | je nu       | you and them    |
|    -2nd | vu nu       | them and I      |
|    -3rd | ley nu      | you and I       |

Finally we can refer to all persons using the ...

|     All |             |                 |


## Lesson 6: Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used to *point* to things. In English these are the words *this*, *that*, *these* and *those*. In Fu Lang there is only one demonstrative word, `va`, but it is a single slot predicate that takes a personal pronoun as it's argument.

    je va   - this thing relative to me
    vu va   - that thing relative to you
    ley va  - that thing relative to them

Other Fu Lang words can be used to agument the demonstrative besides personal pronouns. For example the word *up* (pronounced "oop"), which means "up" as in English, can be used to mean "that up there", "up va".

 or `daawn va` meaning "that down there".

It should also be noted that demonstratives have no sense of gender. One can say `tu va` to mean a person as well as a thing.


## Lesson 7: Gender 

Unlike most other natural languages, it is never necessary to specify gender. But it can be given if it is helpful to clarify what is being said. There are three words to describe gender, one for masculine, one for feminine and one for transgendered or asexual indiviudals. These are all single-valence words (*un wr*).

    fe  - X is female; *ley fe* means "she"
    mo  - X is male; *ley mo* means "he"
    enu - X is transgendered or asexual


## Lesson 8: Thing-In-Itself

The word `ve` is similar to English "the" 

    ve blu kol  - the color blue

    ve fem - woman/girl, lit. the female

The word ** means each.

These the only words in __ that have a concept of number built-in. 


## Lesson 9: Numbers

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   
    zo  un  du  twa kwa san ses sep otc nev

    du nem - base 2 
    - base 4
    - base 6
    - base 8
    - base 10
    - base 12
    - base 16

To form numbers larger than nine, simply string the words together.

    10 = unzo
    23 = dutwa
    42 = kwadu
    sanotczozo = 5800

Fu Lang also has words for numbers ten thru sixteen to facilitate the use of hexidecimal.

    10  11  12  13  14  15  16
    des ev  

## Lesson 10: ?

        - most / best
    mor - more than average
        - average
    les - less than average
        - least / worst

Examples

   ta mi mor
   you I more/better
   you more than I


## Lesson 10: Musical Notes

    do  - A
    rey - B
    mi  - C
    fa  - D
    sol - E
    la  - F
    ti  - G

    - sharp
    - flat


## Lesson 10: Tense and Aspect

Unlike English and most other languages, tense and aspect are optional. This will seem strange to most people. After all, all events happen in time. But the beauty of this is that the temporal information of the statement can be set before hand, or clarified after the fact. This removes a lot of unnecessary verbage from sentences. For example, by starting a story out, "Long long ago...", there really is no need to use the past tense with every verb that follows. We have already been informed that the story is set in the past.

There are three tense *un wr* 

    pa  - X1 is in the past
    naw - X1 is in the present
    fu  - X1 is in the future

And two aspects,

    pur - complete/perfect
    ya  - incomplete/imperfect

The complete aspect, also know as *perfect*, describes an action as have been completed. Where as the incomplete, or *imperfect*, aspect describes an action or state that is on-going.

Tense and aspect are usually placed after the main predicate of a sentence. However, they can technically modify any word, which allows for very nuanced statements with regards to time.


## 

The precise meaning of a *zo wr* can vary depending on the predicate slot they fill. For example, *blu* means the color blue when used with `kol`, but it means `sad` when used with `emo`.

    mi blu kol - I am blue (in color)
    mi blu emo - I am sad

This a very important feature of __. It is what makes it possible to have so few words compared to more complex languages and yet still convey the same degree of nuance in thought.

    mi kor li dim ruj kol se ram

    mi toy round sheip li dim ruj kol se ram

    I throw the small red ball.


## Transitive Predicates

Predicates with three slots are typicallay transative predicates, which simple means they describe an act of transferance. For example, throwing a ball requires a thrower, the thing being thrown and the that which is being thrown to or at.

    mi ley vu fro
    I it you throw
    I throw it to/at you


## Macros

There are a dozen or so words that have strictly grammatical use. They do not have any inhient meaning. Instead they manipulate a predicate to alter its structure. 

    se - swap the 1st and 2nd slots
       - swap the 1st and 3rd slots
       - swap the 1st and 4th slots
