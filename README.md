# Fu Lang

## Introduction

Presently this language has not officval name. So for the time being is will be called **fu lang**.

__ is an expiremental constructured language exploring the suitabiltiy and potential productively of a logical stack-based grammar and the a size limited lexicon. The ultimate goal, should the experiment prove successful, is to allow __ to flourish as an auxilary language which is simple enough for anyone to learn relatively quickly, yet powerful enough to be a complete form of communication.


## Lesson 1: Letters and Sounds

Most of the sounds of __ are recognizable by any English speaker. Only a few sounds will be uncommon to the English ear. These *foreign* sounds aren't difficult, so much as they simply require practice.


### Vowels

There are six vowels, three short vowels and three long vowels. Long vowels sound like constrained forms of the short vowels and are pronounced slightly longer.

| roman   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
|   a     | 'ah' as in 'father'    |     \[ɑ]         |
|   e     | 'eh' as in 'bed'       |                  |
|   o     | 'oh' as in 'pony'      |     \[o̞]         |
|   aa    | 'a'  as in 'fat'       |     \[æ]         |
|   i     | 'ee' as in 'feet'      |     \[i]         |
|   u     | 'oo' as in 'boot'      |     \[u]         |
|   r     | 'ur' in burt           |                  |

Diphthongs are dual vowel sounds that glide together seamlessly. There are nine diphthongs which are divided into three groups: iotic, omicronic and rhotic.

Iotic diphthongs trail off into an 'i' sound and are denoted by adding a `y` to the base vowel.

Omicronic diphthongs trail off into a `u` sound and are denoted by adding a `w` to the base vowel.

Rhotic vowels trail off into an 'r' sound. It can be trilled if desired. There are four rhotic vowels, three for the short vowels and one for the long 'i' vowel.

| roman   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
|   ay    | 'uy' in 'buy'          |                  |
|   ey    | 'ay' in 'bay'          |                  |
|   oy    | 'oy' in 'boy'          |                  |
|         |                        |                  |
|   aw    | 'aw' in 'dawn'         |                  |
|  aaw    | 'ow' in 'down'         |                  |
|         |                        |                  | 
|   ar    | 'ar' in bar            | \[a˞]             |
|   er    | 'ear' in bear          | \[e˞]             |
|   or    | 'oar' in boar          | \[o˞]             |
|   ir    | 'eer' in beer          | \[i˞]             |



=BEGIN DEPRECATE
**Nuniated Vowels**. Vowels can be nuniated by adding an 'ng' sound. This is similar to the English word 'sing', but the sound is softer --the 'g' in the English sound is not emphesized.

| roman  | sound    | phonetic symbol |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
|  an    | song     | \[an]           |
|  en    | bang     | \[en]           |
|  on    | tounge   | \[on]   ?       |
|  in    | sing     | \[in]           |
|  oyn   | boing    | \[oin]          |
|  awn   | tongs    | \[aun]          |

Nuniated vowels should be used sparingly throughout the lexicology. They are not meant to be a mainstay of the phonology, but merely supplemental.

### Consonants

Note, we are considering removing the morphemic distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants.

| roman letter   | sound                  |  phonetic symbol |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|   k            | 'k' in king            |      \[k]        |
|   g            | 'g' in game            |      \[g]        |
|   t            | 't' in time            |      \[t]        |
|   d            | 'd' in dog             |      \[d]        |
|   p            | 'p' in pie             |      \[p]        |
|   b            | 'b' in boat            |      \[b]        |
|   x            | 'ch' in loch           |      \[ ]        |
|   x'           | 'gh' in arghhh         |      \[ ]        |
|   c            | 'sh' in shoe           |      \[c]        |
|   j            | 's' in measure         |      \[j]        |
|   s            | 's' in sun             |      \[s]        |
|   z            | 'z' in zoo             |      \[z]        |
|   f            | 'f' in farm            |      \[f]        |
|   v            | 'v' in vine            |      \[v]        |
|   n            | 'n' in 'noon'          |      \[n]        |
|   l            | 'l' in lemon           |      \[l]        |
|   m            | 'm' in 'moon'          |      \[m]        |
|   y'           |                        |      \[ʁ]        |
|   y            | 'y' in 'yellow'        |      \[j]        |
|   r            | 'r' in 'rain'          |      \[r]        |
|   w            | 'w' in 'west'          |      \[w]        |
|   \|           | stop                   |                  |

The consonant 'r' should be *not* be trilled if is starts a word, but it should be trilled otherwise. This can take some practice. Don't concern yourself with it if you just need to read through a word and can't preform the trill yet. But keep practicing!

Notice there is no 'h'. This sound is reserved to disambiguate the pronunciation of successive words.


## Lession 2: The Shape of Words

In __ all words are single syllables. There are no exceptions to this, which means there are a finite number of words in the language, approximately 10,000. While still a large number it is a managable size, and one can actually learn every single word in the language, unlike other languages, particularly English, which has hundreds of thousands of word, many only known to dictionary writers.

Word forms follow the following patterns, where `V` a vowel, `VG` forms a valid dipthong and `C` is a consonant or valid consonant cluster. Beside each pattern is the number of possible words that can be produced using the pattern (excluding consonant clusters).

| Pattern   | No. of Words  |
|-----------|---------------|
| `V`       | 6             |
| `VG`      | 8             |
| `VC`      | 120           |
| `VGC`     | 160           |
| `CV`      | 120           |
| `CVG`     | 160           |
| `CVC`     | 2400          |
| `CVGC`    | 3200          |

The initial consonant of a word can be any consonant listed above or any of the following permissable consonant clusters:

| letters         | sound                  | phonetic symbol  |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|   tc            | 'ch' in 'church'       |      \[C]        |
|   dj            | 'dj' in 'fudge'        |      \[J]        |
|                 | '  ' in '    '         |      \[ ]        |
|   gr            | 'gh' in 'argh'         |      \[ ]        |

Likewise there are the permissable final clusters:

| letters         | sound                  | phonetic symbol  |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|   ng            | 'ng' in 'song'         |      \[N]        |

While other initial and final consonant clusters are allowed, they are intended to be **used very sparingly** and primarily for foreign barrowings. In fact originally they were not intended to be allowed at all, but in a pinch these are all considered *pronouncable* initial clusters:

| initial letter | clusters              |
|----------------|-----------------------|
|   k            | kl kr kw ky           |
|   g            | gl gr gw              |
|   t            | tl ts tc tr           |
|   d            | dj    dz dr           |
|   p            | pl pr ps              |
|   b            | bl br bz              |
|   x            | xl xr xw              |
|   x'           |                       |
|   c            | cp ct ck cn cl cm cw  |
|   j            | jb jd jg jn jl jm jw  |
|   s            | sp st sk sn sl sm sw  |
|   z            | zb zd zg zn zl zm zw  |
|   f            | fl fr fw              |
|   v            | vl vr vw              |
|   m            | ml mr                 |

And these are considered pronouncable final clusters:

| final letter   | clusters            |
|----------------|---------------------|
|   k            |                     |
|   g            |                     |
|   t            | st ct               |
|   d            | zd                  |
|   p            | sp                  |
|   b            |                     |
|   x            |                     |
|   x'           |                     |
|   c            | tc kc nc mc         |
|   j            | dj nj mj            |
|   s            | ps ts ks ns ms      |
|   z            | bz dz gz nz mz      |
|   f            |                     |
|   v            |                     |
|   l            |                     |
|   m            |                     |

Again these clusters should not be used if at all avoidable. 


## Lesson 3: Resolving Ambiguity

When words are pronounced in succession it is possible for ambiguity to arise. For example, if someone says, "ko sem", a listener could mistaken it for "kos em". Most other languages use *stress* to help clarify word separation. __ does not. Instead it uses two simple pronunciation rules.

When a word ends with the same consonant that the next word begins, a noticable pause between the words must be heard, or a short 'e', as in the English word 'bet' can be placed between them. For example, "kol lun" when spoken quickly will sound like "kol'e'lun".

If a word beings with a vowel which could create an ambiguity when pronounced against the final sound of the previous word, then an aspiration is used to ensure clarity. For example `sol en` would be pronounced "sol hen" to ensure it is not mistaken for "so len". This aspiration does not need to be overly emphasized, a brief and soft aspiration is sufficent.


## Lesson 4: Words and Sentences

Simple words in __ are called `zo wer` which literally means "zero word". The zero because they are not predicates and thus have "zero" slots to fill. The most common *zo wer* are pronouns.

Single slot words are ...

Words never have more than four slots, and four slot words are quite rare.

A sentence has a least one predicate, and consequenly at least one `zo wer` to fill the predicates slot.

    je fem
    I am female

    a na tu mor
    I you love
    I love you


## Lession 4: Negation

There are few different types of negation.

Set negation, 'nu', refers to a set of things from which a given object is excluded. For example, `vu nu` means everyone but you, or in other words 'I and them'. The exact set is contextual, it does not necessarily mean the set of all things.

... negation, 'nay', refers to the opposite of a thing. For instance the opposite of 'up' is 'down' and the opposite of 'joy' is 'misery'. This form of negation is open to interpretation.


## Lesson 5: Personal Pronouns

Pronouns are the most commonly used *zo wr*.

| Person  |             |                 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
|     1st | je/ay/mi    | I               |
|     2nd | vu          | you             |
|     3rd | ley         | he/she/it       |

There is also a *4th Person* pronoun `fo` which is similar to 3rd person but is used to distinguish the two references.

Using negation we can speak of *negtive persons*.

| Person  |             |                 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
|    -1st | je nu       |                 |
|    -2nd | vu nu       |                 |
|    -3rd | ley nu      |                 |

Finally we can refer to all persons using the ...

|     All |             |                 |


## Lesson 6: Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used to *point* to things. In English these are the words *this*, *that*, *these* and *those*. In __ there is only one demonstrative word, `va`, but it is a single slot predicate that takes a personal pronoun as it's argument.

    je da   - this thing relative to me
    vu da   - that thing relative to you
    ley da  - that thing relative to them

Other __ words can be used to agument the demonstrative besides personal pronouns. For example the word for `up` can be used to mean "that up there" or `daawn va` meaning "that down there".

It should also be noted that demonstratives have no sense of gender. One can say `tu va` to mean a person as well as a thing.


## Lesson 7: Gender 

Unlike English and most other natural languages, it is never necessary to specify gender. But it can be given if it is helpful to clarify what is being said. There are three words to describe gender, one for masculine, one for feminine and one for transgendered or asexual indiviudals. These are all single-valence words.

    fe  - x is female; *ley fe* means "she"
    mo  - x is male; *ley mo* means "he"
    enu - x is transgendered or asexual


## Lesson 8: Thing-In-Itself

The word `ve` is similar to English "the" 

    ve blu kol  - the color blue

    ve fem - woman/girl, lit. the female

The word ** means each.

These the only words in __ that have a concept of number built-in. 


## Lesson 9: Numbers


## Lesson 10: Musical Notes

    do  - 1
    rey - 2
    mi  - 3
    fa  - 4
    sol - 5
    la  - 6
    ti  - 7


## Lesson 10: Tense and Aspect

Unlike English and most other languages, tense and aspect are optional. This will seem strange to most people. After all, all events happen in time. But the beauty of this is that the temporal information of the statement can be set before hand, or clarified after the fact. This removes a lot of unnecessary verbage from sentences. For example, by starting a story out, "Long long ago...", there really is no need to use the past tense with every verb that follows. We have already been informed that the story is set in the past.

There are three tense *un wr* 

    pa  - X1 is in the past
    naw - X1 is in the present
    fu  - X1 is in the future

And two aspects,

    pur - complete/perfect
    ya  - incomplete/imperfect

The complete aspect, also know as *perfect*, describes an action as have been completed. Where as the incomplete, or *imperfect*, aspect describes an action or state that is on-going.

Tense and aspect are usually placed after the main predicate of a sentence. However, they can technically modify any word, which allows for very nuanced statements with regards to time.


## 

The precise meaning of a *zo wr* can vary depending on the predicate slot they fill. For example, *blu* means the color blue when used with `kol`, but it means `sad` when used with `emo`.

    mi blu kol - I am blue (in color)
    mi blu emo - I am sad

This a very important feature of __. It is what makes it possible to have so few words compared to more complex languages and yet still convey the same degree of nuance in thought.

    mi kor li dim ruj kol se ram

    mi toy round sheip li dim ruj kol se ram

    I throw the small red ball.


## Transitive Predicates

Predicates with three slots are typicallay transative predicates, which simple means they describe an act of transferance. For example, throwing a ball requires a thrower, the thing being thrown and the that which is being thrown to or at.


## Macros

There are a dozen or so words that have strictly grammatical use. They do not have any inhient meaning. Instead they manipulate a predicate to alter its structure. 

    se - swap the 1st and 2nd slots
       - swap the 1st and 3rd slots
       - swap the 1st and 4th slots

    sa - omit the 2nd, 3rd and 4th slot
       - omit the 3rd and 4th slot
       - omit the 4th slot

More than one of these can be used together to produce any predicate slot organization desirable.

    ana se sa pei
    I got paid

Converting predicate slots into objects.

    fa  - 1st slot as object
    fe  - 2nd slot as object
    fu  - 3rd slot as object
    faw - 4th slot as object

For example

    fa pey
    payer

    fe pey
    payee

    fu pey
    amount/denomination paid

Gerund or infinitive

    du  - predicate in itself

    du pey
    to pay / paying
